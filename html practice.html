<h1>I love cats and here's why</h1>
<p>Cats are amazing animals because they are very cute and independent. </p>

<h1>The biology of cats</h1>
<p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.</p>

<h1>Where do cats live?</h1>
<p>The domestic cat is what scientists call a “cosmopolitan species,” which describes a species that has a range that covers most or all possible habitats throughout the world. The killer whale is considered another example of a cosmopolitan species, for it lives anywhere in the ocean. It can be found along most coasts and in deeper waters.

The domestic cat lives on every continent except Antarctica, and it can be found on 118 of the 131 major island groups. It is extremely adaptable and can survive in the hottest deserts and on the highest mountains. Feral cats have been known to live in cities, forests, grasslands, farmland, tundra, wetlands, and scrublands.</p>

<h1>How do cats get food?</h1>
<p>As noted above, cats primarily scavenge for food and eat scraps and refusewhatever food is easiest and most abundant to findand typically hunt only when other, easier food sources are scarce. When they do hunt, cat diet studies show that instead of catching a large number of a specific species of bird, they catch individual birds of several different speciesusually the most common species in the area.4 A study of cat predation on rabbits similarly observed that cats’ prey is the most numerous prey species in that area for that time of year. Endangered species were rarely on the menu, and even then not as the primary prey.

  <h3>what do they eat?</h3>
  <p>Cooked beef, chicken, turkey, and small amounts of lean deli meats are a great way to give them that. Raw or spoiled meat could make your cat sick.</p>

<div class="myDiv">
  <h3>what nutrients do they need?</h3>
  <p>iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride.</p>

  <h3>how should I feed my cat?</h3>
  <p>Cats should eat at least two meals each day, about 12 hours apart. But a breakfast, lunch, afternoon, dinner, and right before bed schedule is an equally great option. If more than 12 hours elapses between meals, the stomach can become hyperacidic causing nausea.</p>
