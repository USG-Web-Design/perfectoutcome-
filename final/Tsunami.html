	<h1>What is a Tsunami?</h1>
		<p>A tsunami is a series of waves caused by earthquakes or undersea volcanic eruptions. 
			<br>Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases. The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves.</p>

	<h1>The types of Tsunami?</h1>
		<p>There are three distinct types of tsunami. The type you encounter depends on the distance you are from the place where it is generated.</p>
	<h2>distant tsunami</h2>
		<p> Are generated from a long way away, such as from across the Pacific in Chile. In this case, we will have more than three hours warning time for New Zealand.</p>
	<h2>Reigional tsunami</h2>
		<p> Are generated between one and three hours travel time away from their destination. An eruption from an underwater volcano in the Kermadec Trench to the north of New Zealand, could generate a regional tsunami.</p>
	<h2>Local tsunami</h2>
		<p>Are generated very close to New Zealand. This type of tsunami is very dangerous because we may only have a few minutes warning.</p>

	<h1>Where do tsunami come from?</h1>
		<p>Tsunami can come from different sources.
A distant source tsunami, like one generated from Chile, could take 14 hours or more to arrive. A regional source tsunami, like one generated from the Southwest Pacific, could take between one and three hours to arrive. In these cases we will have time to issue official warning messages. A local source tsunami generated from an earthquake close to New Zealand, can arrive at New Zealand coastal areas within minutes.
